% This function takes a matrix of desired setpoints and generates a
% trajectory that passes through all of them
% pointMatrix is a nx3 matrix with columns of x, y, and z setpoints
% TODO: Add a time argument that allows the user to specify the amount of
% time for the total trajectory. We will have to assume that each setpoint
% has the same desired time unless we expand to set them individually

function pointMatrix = findTotalTrajectory(points)

    lastA = [0 0 0];
    for k : size(points, 1)
        A = points(k,:);
        x = trajectorygen(0,2,0,0,
        lastA = A;
    end
